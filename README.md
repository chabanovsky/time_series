This repository contains a few models that allows one to try to find some sense in time series data. 

1. I have built models as an implementation for the https://otexts.org/fpp2/ book. Models are not full functioned ones. It's more for understanding how they work and how to create one yourself. 
2. SSA model has been written after reading [notes from lectures in Moscow State University](http://chaos.phys.msu.ru/loskutov/PDF/Annot_time_series_analysis.pdf). It works well except that in the notes guys choose the main components manually. So, it's not straightforward who to do it automatically. I personally group them in the order of the eigenvalues. It's an open question and when I have time I'm going to emial the athors of the SSA mathed.
